			<h2>How to Play</h2>
		
	
			<p class="intro">Once you have become spoked, take some time to prepare for the battle. Get your phone setup and craft your strategy for winning.</p>
						
			<h3>What you need</h3>
	
			<p>4-12 spoked friends with intelligent phones and bicycles (owned or borrowed)
			</br>Tracking app for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-gps/id299949744?mt=8#">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks&hl=en">Android</a> (see setup below)
			</br>Twitter account (optional)</p>
			
			
			<h3>Track your rides</h3>
			<p>A SPOKED battle lasts for two weeks. It starts Monday at 6 am, and ends Sunday at midnight. Track every bike ride you take for the duration of the battle. Access your rides and smiles on the game board by logging in to iamspoked.com. (Note: the game board  happens to work very well on a computer, but not so well on tablets and smart phones just yet.)</p>
			
			<p>After tracking your first ride of the game, tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/iamspoked">@iamspoked</a> so we can make sure your ride made it to our inbox, and onto the map!</p>
			
			<p>Cab rides, subway trips and walking will disqualify you. </p>
			
			<h3>Scoring</h3>
			<p>1 mile = 1 smile on a normal day<br />
			1 mile = 2 smiles on your <em>super-spoked</em> day</p>
			
			<p>A super-spoked day is your third day of consecutive riding. The counter resets the fourth day. Keep track of upcoming super-spoked days on your profile. The contestant with the most smiles wins!</p>

<p><strong>SETUP</strong><br /></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open the app. Go to <em>Menu > Setup > Share</em></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Scroll down to Email share and the form below it. </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Write your Display name: Firstname Lastname. This needs to be the very same name as the name you registered in your SPOKED account.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Send to: yes@iamspoked.com</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Send to: your own email address to keep track of whether or not you have shared a ride.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Set Email Share switch to ON. </p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Scroll down and set One-Click share to ON. Then you can easily hit the Share button after you biked, and your data will be sent to SPOKED immediately.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Press Done. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>TRACK RIDES</strong><br /> </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open the app. Go to <em>Menu > Record track</em></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Hit Reset track if you have previously tracked a ride, to make sure you start at 00:00:00.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Hit Start track. This typically needs to happen when you&#8217;re outside so the phone has GPS signal &#8211; when globe is blue &#038; green.</p>
<p>NOW RIDERIDERIDE!</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Pause track when you&#8217;re at your destination.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Save track </p>
