			<h2>Game rules</h2>
			
	
			<p class="intro">A game is not a game without a clear framework to play within. New York City is your game board–here are your rules!</p>
			
			<p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 4-12<br />
			<strong>Game duration:</strong> 2 weeks (starting on a Monday 6 am; ending on a Sunday at midnight)</p>
			
			<h3>How to play</h3>
			<p>Track every bike ride you take using MotionX (iPhone) or MyTracks (Android) for the duration of the game. Press start at the beginning of the ride and stop at the end. Share your ride with yes@iamspoked.com at the end of the ride. Your beautiful patterns will emerge on the map. This map happens to work very well on a computer, but not so well on tablet and smart phones just yet.</p>
			
			<p>Go to <a href="phone-setup.html">Phone setup</a> to get started with the apps and learn about their special kinks and quirks. After tracking your first ride of the game, tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/iamspoked">@iamspoked</a> so we can make sure your ride made it to our inbox, and onto our map!</p>
			
			<h3>How to win</h3>
			<p>Earn the most smiles :) You gain the smiles by riding miles.</p>
			
			<p>1 mile = 1 smile on a normal day<br />
			1 mile = 2 smiles on your <em>super-spoked</em> day</p>
			
			<p>Super-spoked days are your third day of consecutive riding. The counter resets the fourth day.</p>
			
			<h3>What you need</h3>
	
			<p>
You will need 4-12 spoked friends with intelligent phones and bicycles (owned or borrowed). Each player needs a tracking app—<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-gps/id299949744?mt=8#">MotionX-GPS</a> ($1) for iPhone or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks&hl=en">My Tracks</a> (free) for Android. A SPOKED app is on the roadmap, but for now the mentioned apps work very well with the SPOKED web interface. <a href="phone-setup.html">Here's how you set up your phone</a> to get the data to us. </a></p>

			<p>If you want to get really excited during the game, you probably should have a Twitter account so SPOKED can talk to you.</p>

			
			<h3>Common Questions</h3>
			
			<p><strong>Will tracking drain my battery?</strong><br />
			Maybe, but you should still be able to get through the day (depending on your internet usage). It's been fine for us as long as we charge up every night.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Does the phone display need to be on for the app to be tracking?</strong><br />
			Nope. You can press the sleep button on your phone after you start tracking.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What happens if I forget to track?</strong><br />
			Start as soon as you remember. Your rides must be tracked to be counted.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if the app stops tracking in the middle of a ride?</strong><br />
			That sucks. Especially if you were about to make some really snazzy patterns on that map. MotionX and MyTracks are stable. However, we have seen this happen. Unfortunately, we can do nothing about it...</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I stop along my ride?</strong><br />
			If you stop for coffee or to take a photo, keep tracking. If you're stopping for more than 10 minutes, we recommend that you send your rides in splits. For example, bike to the first place, then stop recording and send your ride to us. Start recording again once your wheels are rolling (or preferably a tiny bit before so you don't hit a pot hole while staring at your phone). MotionX has a tendency to time out if you're indoors and idle for too long.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I bike outside of New York City and go off the map?</strong><br />
			Good question. We’re testing that now.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I bike around midnight–which day does the ride belong to?</strong><br /> 
			A ride belongs to the day where the tracking is started. This means that on a Monday night, your ride will count for the Monday if the tracking starts Monday <em>before</em> midnight, and will count for the Tuesday if it is started after midnight.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I don't remember if I sent my ride to you or not?</strong><br /> 
			We encourage you to set up your phone so you send your ride to yourself as well as yes@iamspoked.com. If you do not remember whether you sent a ride or not, check your own email before sending the ride again. If you happen to send a ride twice, please let us know through email. We are working out a few kinks in this area right now, and will be able to detect twin rides in the future.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I forget to reset the MotionX tracking app before starting to track a new ride?</strong><br /> 
			Unfortunately, this mistake is easy to make in MotionX. Try to remember to hit <em>Reset Track</em> and see all the zeroes every time before hitting <em>Start Track</em>. However, if you happen to send a ride that wasn't reset, it means you sent that ride together with the ride before. Please let us know through email which rides this involves, and we can try to delete the one ride before the "double-ride".
			</p>
			
			<h3>You should know</h3>
			<p>Cab rides, subway trips and walking will disqualify you. </p>
