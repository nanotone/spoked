			<h3>What you need</h3>
	
			<p>
You will need 6-12 spoked friends with intelligent phones and bicycles (owned or borrowed). Each player need a tracking app—MotionX GPS for iPhone ($1) or MyTracks for Android (free). We hope to make our own app in the future, but for now these work very well with our SPOKED web interface. Here's how you set up the iPhone to get the data to us. </a></p>

			<p>If you want to get really excited during the game, you probably should have a Twitter account so we can talk to you.</p>

			<!--<h3>LET’S PLAY!</h3>
			
			<p>When you’re playing a SPOKED game, by tracking your rides with an iPhone or Android, you get to make snazzy patterns on a map with the color of your choice. You get to share the patterns and feel the wonderful social pressure by people around you to bike a little more than usual. You’ll also get encouraged in the currency “smiles” to bike consistently, and nudged on twitter when your bike is calling for you to get on the streets. Most importantly, you get to take part of a little two week adventure that just might change your lifestyle forever!</p>
	
			<h3>GAME BOARD</h3>
			<p>(screenshot)</p>
			
			<p>Compare with your closest rivals and see everyone’s snazzy patterns emerge on the city map.</p>
	
			<h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>
	
			<p>
			Pedal up smiles, by riding miles. 1 mile  = 1 smile. You get extra smiles for riding consistently. If you ride for 3 consecutive days, your third day is a super-spoked day. You get double the smiles for your miles gained that day. The counter for consecutive days resets on day 4. The winner is the one who ramps up the most smiles!</p>
			
			<p>(Track every single bike ride during the game with your phone, # of contestants, Duration)

			<h3>APP REQUIREMENTS</h3>
	
			<p>MotionX GPS for iPhone ($1) or MyTracks for Android (free). We hope to make our own app in the future, but for now these work very well with our SPOKED web interface.</p>
