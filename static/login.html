						During the battle, track every ride you take. SPOKED will convert your bike rides into beautiful marks on a city map shared with your friends. To make this happen, your phones need to be smart. Both the iPhone and Android are acceptable.

			<p>
You will need 4-12 spoked friends with intelligent phones and bicycles (owned or borrowed). Each player needs a tracking appâ€”<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-gps/id299949744?mt=8#">MotionX-GPS</a> ($1) for iPhone or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks&hl=en">My Tracks</a> (free) for Android. A SPOKED app is on the roadmap, but for now the mentioned apps work very well with the SPOKED web interface. <a href="phone-setup.html">Here's how you set up your phone</a> to get the data to us. </a></p>

			<p>If you want to get really excited during the game, you probably should have a Twitter account so SPOKED can talk to you.</p>
