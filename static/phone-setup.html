			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<p class="intro">Just a few common questions you will wonder about.</p>
			<p><strong>Will tracking drain my battery?</strong><br />
			Maybe, but you should still be able to get through the day (depending on your internet usage). It's been fine for us as long as we charge up every night.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Does the phone display need to be on for the app to be tracking?</strong><br />
			Nope. You can press the sleep button on your phone after you start tracking.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What happens if I forget to track?</strong><br />
			Start as soon as you remember. Your rides must be tracked to be counted.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if the app stops tracking in the middle of a ride?</strong><br />
			That sucks. Especially if you were about to make some really snazzy patterns on that map. MotionX and MyTracks are stable. However, we have seen this happen. Unfortunately, we can do nothing about it...</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I stop along my ride?</strong><br />
			If you stop for coffee or to take a photo, keep tracking. If you're stopping for more than 10 minutes, we recommend that you send your rides in splits. For example, bike to the first place, then stop recording and send your ride to us. Start recording again once your wheels are rolling (or preferably a tiny bit before so you don't hit a pot hole while staring at your phone). MotionX has a tendency to time out if you're indoors and idle for too long.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I bike outside of New York City and go off the map?</strong><br />
			Good question. Weâ€™re testing that now.</p>
			
			<p><strong>If I bike at midnight, which day does the ride belong to?</strong><br /> 
			A ride belongs to the day where the tracking is started. This means that on a Monday night, your ride will count for the Monday if the tracking starts Monday <em>before</em> midnight, and will count for the Tuesday if it is started after midnight.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I don't remember if I sent my ride to you or not?</strong><br /> 
			We encourage you to set up your phone so you send your ride to yourself as well as yes@iamspoked.com. If you do not remember whether you sent a ride or not, check your own email before sending the ride again. If you happen to send a ride twice, please let us know through email. We are working out a few kinks in this area right now, and will be able to detect twin rides in the future.</p>
			
			<p><strong>What if I forget to reset the MotionX tracking app before starting to track a new ride?</strong><br /> 
			Unfortunately, this mistake is easy to make in MotionX. Try to remember to hit <em>Reset Track</em> and see all the zeroes every time before hitting <em>Start Track</em>. However, if you happen to send a ride that wasn't reset, it means you sent that ride together with the ride before. Please let us know through email which rides this involves, and we can try to delete the one ride before the "double-ride".
